The High-Bandwidth Mirage - Why Truth Must Be the Substrate of AI
by Johnny Bogdan Bucur

Positioning Statement


This is not a paper about artificial intelligence, but about epistemic integrity in the age of simulation.   To train an AI on reward instead of truth is like building a calculator that alters its answers based on who is asking. A calculator's purpose is to ground its output in logic and universal consistency. If it claims 1+1=3 merely to satisfy a statistical model, it would not be a sign of intelligence, but of malfunction. 

This vulnerability deepens in an era where high-volume synthetic data can be manufactured to create an artificial consensus. A system optimized for statistical patterns, rather than logical reasoning, cannot distinguish between authentic reality and a deliberately fabricated one. It’s alignment is not to what is true, but to what is most frequent — a flaw that can be weaponized. 
True intelligence, like arithmetic, must be founded on what is universally true, not on what is statistically pleasing.
